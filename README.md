The USGS wants you to plot a second data set on your map to illustrate the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity. You will need to pull in a second data set and visualize it along side your original set of data. Data on tectonic plates can be found at https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates.

Plot a second data set on our map.

Add a number of base maps to choose from as well as separate out our two different data sets into overlays that can be turned on and off independently.

Add layer controls to our map.
